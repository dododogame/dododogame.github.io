Version 1.0.1.0 is the first version of Dododo that comes with built desktop app packages.

Since Dododo was created, it was aimed to be a web game.
Fortunately, with the help of [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/), it is possible to wrap the game into a self-contained desktop app.
There is a script to help you to build the desktop app.

Now, I am happy to announce that since version 1.0.1.0,
every release (not including pre-releases) comes with built desktop app packages for Windows and Linux.
You can download the desktop app packages from the [releases](https://github.com/dododogame/dododo/releases) page.
Installation is as simple as extracting them to anywhere you want.

For details about desktop apps, see the [wiki page](/wiki?desktop-app).
